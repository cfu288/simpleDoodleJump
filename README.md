# YoshiJump

This is my version of "Doodlejump" based on the provided framework.

I've made several improvements to the base framework:
- Keeping score
- Start screen
- Improved sprites - No more colored boxes!
- Enemies
- Improved physics
	- Platforms move down with variable accelerations in order to keep character on screen
	- Character moves up with variable accelerations to keep character on screen
