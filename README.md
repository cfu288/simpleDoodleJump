# YoshiJump

This is my version of "Doodlejump" based on the provided framework.

I've made several improvements to the base framework:
- Keeping score
- High score
- Character lives so you get a second chance
- Start screen
- Improved sprites - No more colored boxes!
- Enemies with bounce interactions
- Improved spacing of platforms 
	- Platforms should be better spaced out
- Improved physics
	- Platforms move down with variable accelerations in order to keep character on screen
	- Character moves up with variable accelerations to keep character on screen

Known Bugs: 
- High score does not update immediately, nees you to start and back out of another game.
